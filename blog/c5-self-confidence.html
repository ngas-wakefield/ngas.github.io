<h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>

<p>Mindfullness is being conscious of your environment and being present observing your thoughts and emotions and finding ease.

<p>Self-awareness is being conscious of your own 'self'. Acknowledging how your mind operates and how you affect the environment and understand what drives you subconsciously and being aware of your actions.</p>

 <h4>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h4>

<p>I noticed while using the body scanning technique I was able to cancel out my thoughts and only focus on the parts of my body as long as I pay attention.</p>

<p>I already use the journaling technique, using it both for work planning and expression. I use drawings as a way to visualize what I am thinking before I can put it into words or just to write notes and remember things.</p>

<h4> What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h4>
<p>I don't actually believe this one, emotions are me because without them you are not experiencing life or learning lessons to help you grow. It is learning to regulate your emotions and feelings instead of ignoring them.</p>
